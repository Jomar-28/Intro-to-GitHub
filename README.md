•	Explain what Git is and how it differs from GitHub.
Git is a version control system that facilitates source code history management and tracking. GitHub is an online hosting platform that facilitates the management of Git repositories. Git-based open-source projects can be more effectively managed with the aid of GitHub.
After all, name standards aren't always obvious in the field of programming. It's important to                      understand the similarities and distinctions between GitHub and Git, two programs with similar names. Git and GitHub offer programmers useful version control features that allow them to work on ongoing projects without worrying about making mistakes. Git is merely surpassed by GitHub, which provides additional features and resources in addition to an online workspace for project storing and collaboration.

•	Describe the purpose of version control in software development
Every change made to the code is tracked by version control software in a unique type of database. When an error occurs, engineers can go back in time and compare previous iterations of the code to assist correct the problem with the least amount of disturbance to the other members of the team.

•	Briefly explain the basic concepts of Git (e.g., repositories, commits, branches, pull requests, and merging).
1.	Repositories: A repository (repo) is a project’s folder containing all the files and their revision history, managed by Git.
2.	Commits: A commit is a snapshot of the project at a specific point in time, representing a change or update to the codebase.
3.	Branches: Branches allow developers to work on separate features or fixes independently from the main codebase (usually called main or master).
4.	Pull Requests: A pull request is a proposal to merge changes from one branch into another, usually to integrate feature branches back into the main branch after review.
5.	Merging: Merging is the process of integrating changes from one branch into another, combining the work done in different branches.
