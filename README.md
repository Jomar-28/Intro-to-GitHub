A repository is the most basic element of GitHub. It's a place where you can store your code, your files, and each file's revision history. Repositories can have multiple collaborators and can be either public or private.

Branch	        A parallel version of your code that is contained within the repository, but does not affect the primary or main branch.
Clone	        To download a full copy of a repository's data from GitHub.com, including all versions of every file and folder.
Fork	        A new repository that shares code and visibility settings with the original "upstream" repository.
Merge	        To take the changes from one branch and apply them to another.
Pull request	A request to merge changes from one branch into another.
Remote	        A repository stored on GitHub, not on your computer.
Upstream	The branch on an original repository that has been forked or cloned. The corresponding branch on the cloned or forked branch is called the "downstream."
